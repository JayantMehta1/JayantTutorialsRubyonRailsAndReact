# README

I am currently working on developing a platform to host my video tutorials and presentations.

It has been great using Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.js for the frontend along with a PostgreSQL database.

The deployment link for the project is: https://jayanttutorialsrailsandreact.herokuapp.com/
