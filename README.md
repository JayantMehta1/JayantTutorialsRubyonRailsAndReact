# Objective
Welcome to Jayant Tutorials!

I am currently developing a learning platform to host tutorials and presentations. I will soon be adding actual tutorials. My next step is to set up a user database with log in to allow users to keep track of their learning and refer to tutorials efficiently (cutomized to their learning environment).

# Technologies
For this full stack project, I am using Ruby on Rails for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and a PostgreSQL database to store the module information. I deployed Jayant Tutorials to Heorku.

# Access Link
The deployment link for the project is: https://jayanttutorialsrailsandreact.herokuapp.com/
